# Line Following Pesticide Spraying Rover

An autonomous rover designed for agricultural automation using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU). It follows a line using IR sensors and sprays pesticides using a mini water pump, driven by a relay and servo mechanism.

## Features
- Line following with dual IR sensors
- Pesticide spraying with pump relay
- Motor control using L298N motor driver
- Simple modular setup
- Easily extensible for smart farming projects

## Hardware Used
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- L298N Motor Driver
- IR Sensors (x2)
- Mini Water Pump + Relay Module
- 9g Servo Motor
- 9V Power Source

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `LineFollowingRover.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)` as board
4. Upload to your ESP8266
5. Power the system and place it on a black line track
